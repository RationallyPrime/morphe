/**
 * Morphe EVENT TIERS — the typed taxonomy of the purity contract (Lemma 5).
 *
 * The tier boundaries are LAW, and the law is enforced structurally, not by
 * convention:
 *
 *   TIER 0 — hover, focus, keystroke, scroll, drag. Never leaves the
 *   component. There is deliberately NO Tier0Event type: tier-0 interaction
 *   has no wire representation at all, so it is unrepresentable outside its
 *   component. (The deliverable at tier 0 is the absence of one.)
 *
 *   TIER 1 — a COMMITTED selection, filter edit, expand/collapse, sort.
 *   Commits to the client store and is recorded in the store's bounded
 *   recent-event window — the raw material of the ContextDigest (R1.3).
 *   `Tier1Event` is stamped by the STORE (its injected clock), never by the
 *   primitive: pure code carries no `Date.now()`.
 *
 *   TIER 2 — submit, task transition, an explicit "this view isn't working".
 *   Surfaces as a TYPED CALLBACK at the `MorpheRoot` boundary
 *   (`onEscalate?: (e: Tier2Event) => void`) — not a DOM event, not a store
 *   write. A tier-2 event's payload is `JsonValue`-typed by construction, so
 *   it cannot carry live tier-0 state (no element refs, no handlers, no class
 *   instances are representable).
 *
 * Cross-tier smuggling is type-impossible in both directions: the store's
 * recorder accepts only the tier-1 input shape (it mints `tier: 1` itself),
 * and `onEscalate` accepts only `Tier2Event`. A tier-1 handler has no
 * escalation capability to reach for — input primitives consume the store
 * context, never the escalation context (asserted by the architecture scan in
 * `store.test.ts`).
